# RM Audio Recorder (Android)

This is a Ruby Motion Android app that records audio and plays it back.

The purpose of this app is to see if there are any limitations with using the native audio on Android.

You will need Ruby Motion installed to run the app.

You will also need Android support for Rubymotion:

And an emulator or device. The Android emulator is super slow so install Genymotion if you don't have a device.
